This repository contains different websites/web pages that I've built. The plan is to create one hub from where you can access all of my different web projects.

# What is this?

- Being completely honest, front-end and web development have never been at the center of my interests.
- I enjoy the learning technical aspects of web development in my free time more than the design, UI/UX aspects.

This is why I've decided to track my web development journey in one repository, as I work towards creating a personal portfolio from scratch.

> Note:
> Every line of code in this repository is written completely by me with no help from peers, professors or any AI tools.


# Websites
The following websites are present in this repository.

## A Silent Voice
- This website is a research summary about one of my most favorite movies of all time, 'A Silent Voice'.
- It contains no JavaScript but focuses on classless CSS and designing various types of media such as:
  - Images
  - Audio
  - Embedded Videos, etc.

## Listen Up
- This website is a very basic music application where I wanted to revisit basic CSS styling but this time using classes.
- I've also used JavaScript and bootstrap for forms.
