    <h2>Introduction</h2>

    <p>
      Among them, one such hit was the Japanese romantic drama <em>A Silent Voice</em>, released on
      <time datetime="2016-09-17">September 17, 2016</time>. This movie wasn&apos;t just your
      run-of-the-mill anime romance though. The movie imparted several important life messages and
      touched on social issues. A few of these include:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Bullying</li>
      <li>Mental Health</li>
      <li>
        <s>Redemption</s>
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Repentance" target="_blank">Repentance</a>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      The general plot revolves around the main character <b>Shoyo Ishida</b>
      who tries to rekindle his friendship with a deaf girl whom he bullied back in middle school.
      It also covers important aspects of friendships and misunderstanding, portraying them by
      showing us how his relationships with the people around him develop.

    <h2>Consequences</h2>

    <p>
      In middle school, everything was going normally for Ishida until the day when a deaf girl
      named <b>Shoyo Nishimiya</b> decided to join his class. Ishida, his friends and even their
      other classmates bullied the new girl over the span of weeks. The consequences of this though
      were only faced by Ishida. His friends and the other witnesses turned their back on him and
      testified that Ishida was the only one who took part in the bullying and no other kids were
      involved. This is when everything took a turn in Ishida&apos;s life.
    </p>

    <p>
      The bullying that occurred to Nishimiya didn&apos;t just affect her but also Ishida and the
      other witnesses. When Nishimiya decided to leave the school after repeated incidents, everyone
      started to feel the guilt set in and decided to put the blame all on Ishida. The others are in
      denial that they ever took part in the bullying as this would lead to a confrontation with
      their morality, while over the next few years, Ishida slowly becomes an outcast. This
      exclusion and betrayal leads to Ishida&apos;s

        >depression</a
      >.
    </p>

    <hr />
    <h2>Depression</h2>

    <p>
      A heartbreaking scene that I still remember from the movie even after years is the
      confrontation between Ishida and his mother when she realizes that her son is about to commit
      suicide. You can feel the emotion in every word that she says. This scene was even more
      touching because around the time that I saw the movie I had to confront a person close to me
      who was planning to end their life. This movie doesn&apos;t exaggerate any emotions or
      interactions, rather it depicts them in such a vivid manner that you feel involved regardless
      of the relatability factor.
    </p>

    <p>
      The plot expresses several overlooked aspects of real depression. It does a great job of
      expressing the signs and results of depression. In Ishida&apos;s case, even years after the
      incident, the guilt eats away at him and this results in him completely giving up on life. It
      depicts the character&apos;s development from thinking that suicide is the only way out to
      realizing that giving life another try and confronting his past is the better option.

    <h2>Moving On</h2>
    <p>
      He decides to live life so he can &apos;bear his
      <a href="https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/sin" target="_blank">sins</a> and
      be punished for them&apos;. Throughout high school, he makes no friends and sticks to his
      solitary lifestyle. This phase of his life is a depiction of guilt and anxiety. This social
      anxiety is shown in the movie with
      <b>giant purple crosses seen on the faces of those around him</b>. It also expresses his
      distrust in those around him. For Ishida, everyone is now a stranger who can hate him, hurt
      him and/or betray him.
    </p>

    <p>
      As Ishida battles with his anxiety and attempts at friendships, he meets
      <b>Nagatsuka</b>, who becomes the first person to lose the purple cross. This indicates that
      Ishida is still capable of opening up and becoming comfortable around others. In the words of
      his new friend Nagatsuka, <q>Friendship lies somewhere beyond things like words and logic</q>.
      This sentence is further highlighted as later in the movie the viewer realizes that it&apos;s
      not exactly logical for Nishimiya, someone who was bullied, to become friends with her bully.
    </p>

    <p>
      This movie gives us a different perspective on friendships. As he further explores his journey
      of rekindling his old friendships, he starts to question his happiness. In fact, over the plot
      of the movie, Ishida meets Nishimiya and they decide to become friends. But, somewhere in him
      resides that guilt from middle school which doesn&apos;t let him fully enjoy the newfound
      happiness of true friendship. He still feels as if he needs to be punished and suffer for his
      sins, and that he doesn&apos;t deserve to be happy with his friends.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is only obvious after having seen the movie multiple times but, throughout the plot,
      Ishida was never seeking redemption. In reality, he wanted to be punished. It was repentance
      that he wanted. He still harboured guilt from middle school and understood the lifelong
      consequences of his actions on Nishimiya. This is yet another turning point in the movie.
    </p>

    <hr />
    <h2>Redemption vs Repentance</h2>

    <p>
      <strong
        >Ishida is no longer certain whether he is being Nishimiya&apos;s friend to make up for his
        actions in the past in an attempt to redeem himself, or whether he truly wants to be her
        friend and finds comfort in her.</strong

    <p>
      <abbr>TBH</abbr>, summarising the ending of the plot I believe would ruin the experience.
      Instead, I wish for the readers of this article to watch the movie themselves.
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Silent_Voice_(film)" target="_blank"
        ><em>Eiga Koe No Katachi</em></a
      >, translated as <em>The Shape of Voice</em> is the original Japanese title of the movie. It
      is a tale of repentance and not redemption, engulfed in a subtle layer of youthful romance.
      Based on a manga series by
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yoshitoki_Ōima" target="_blank"
        ><b>Yoshitoki Ōima</b></a

      to broaden their view on life.
