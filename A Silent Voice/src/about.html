      Hey there! I'm a Computer Programing student at <a href>Seneca College</a> @ Newnham.
      <br /><br />
      My programming interests would be back-end development & cybersecurity. Outside of coding, I
      spend my time playing games, watching sit-coms and occasionally binge watching animes. That
      would also explain why my topic for the article was an anime movie.
    </p>
    <p>
      I highly reccomend that the person reading this checks the movie out and if possbile, watched
      it. It's decently sized at being 2 hours long, so the duration shouldn't be a problem.
    </p>

      As for this website, I used media from a wide variety of sources but I ensured that I had the
      rights to use it. In many cases attributions were required as a part of the usage agreement.
      This is why all of the media used has attribution and citation right underneath.
